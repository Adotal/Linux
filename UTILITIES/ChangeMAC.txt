/////////////////// CHANGE MAC ADDRESS //////////////

First, you can check your current MAC address with the command:

# ip link show interface

The section that interests us at the moment is:
link/ether 00:1d:98:5a:d1:3a

The first step to spoofing the MAC address is to bring the network interface down. It can be accomplished with the command:

# ip link set dev interface down

To change the MAC, we need to run the command:

# ip link set dev interface address XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

The final step is to bring the network interface back up. This can be accomplished by running the command:

# ip link set dev interface up
